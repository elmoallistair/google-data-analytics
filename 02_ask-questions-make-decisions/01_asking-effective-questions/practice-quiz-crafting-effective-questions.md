### Question 3

A data analyst working for a mid-sized retailer is writing questions for a customer experience survey. One of the questions is: “Do you prefer online or in-store?” Then, they rewrite it to say: “Do you prefer shopping at our online marketplace or shopping at your local store?” Describe why this is a more effective question.

* The first question is leading, whereas the second question could have many different answers.
* The first question is closed-ended, whereas the second question encourages the respondent to elaborate.
* **The first question is vague, whereas the second question includes important context.**
* The first question contains slang that might not make sense to everyone, whereas the second question is easily understandable.

> Vague questions do not provide context. The second question clarifies that the data analyst wants to learn exactly how and where customers prefer to shop.

### Question 4

A data analyst at a social media company is creating questions for a focus group. They use common abbreviations such as PLS for “please” and LMK for “let me know.” This is fair because the participants use social media a lot and are likely to be technically savvy.

* True
* **False**

> Fairness means asking questions that make sense to everyone. Even if a data analyst suspects people will understand abbreviations, slang, or other jargon, it’s important to write questions with simple wording.
