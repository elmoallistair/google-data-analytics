## The workplace secret sauce, teamwork

&nbsp;

### Question 1

Your supervisor gives you a new data analysis project with unclear instructions, and you become frustrated trying to figure out how to proceed. Before moving forward, what should you do? Select all that apply.

* Go see your supervisor in person so they can clearly understand how stressed out you’re feeling.
* **Do some additional research on your own to better understand the context of the request.**
* **Take a few minutes to calm down, then ask your supervisor more questions to learn about the big picture goals.**
* Send your supervisor an email letting them know they did not explain the project well. 

> Doing additional research and asking questions are effective ways to determine how to proceed with a new project.

### Question 2

You’re working on a data analysis project with a coworker, and the two of you disagree on what the data is telling you. Things get tense. The best course of action is to go to your supervisor and politely explain that your coworker is looking at the data incorrectly. Then, ask to work with a different coworker on future projects.

* True 
* **False**

> Discussion is the key to conflict resolution. If you find yourself in the middle of a conflict, start a conversation so you can each explain your concerns and figure out the best path forward.

### Question 3

A director emails you asking for a report by the end of the week. This type of report takes at least 10 days to complete correctly. What is the best course of action?

* Complete the report as best you can by the end of the week so you meet the requested deadline.
* Forward the email to another data analyst on your team, and ask them to do the report instead. It’ll still be late, but at least it won’t reflect poorly on you.
* **Email the director and say that you would be happy to do that, but you believe it will take 10 days to get the information you need. Then, ask if you can discuss the possibility of a different timeline.**
* Call the director, and let them know there’s no way anyone could possibly meet that deadline.

> The best course of action is to email the director to politely explain the timeline required to complete the report properly.
